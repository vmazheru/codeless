/**
 * This package contains functional interfaces missing from the Java API and methods to convert functions
 * from one type to another.
 * 
 * <p>Many of the functions defined in this package look similar to standard Java 8 functional interfaces,
 * but their methods declare checked exceptions. This allows calling methods which throw checked exceptions
 * inside lambda expressions without try / catch.
